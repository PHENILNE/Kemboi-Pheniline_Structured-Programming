 Kemboi-Pheniline_Structured-Programming - Assignment 4
This repository contains C programs demonstrating various array operations and data handling techniques, suitable for beginners and intermediate learners in C programming. Each program showcases a specific array-related concept including 1D and 2D arrays, sorting, insertion, unique elements, and circular buffers.

Programs Included

Store and Reverse Array

Reads user input into an array.

Prints the array in original and reverse order.

Sum of Array Elements

Calculates and prints the sum of all elements in a 1D array.

Unique Elements in Array

Prints all elements in the array that occur only once.

Maximum and Minimum in Array

Finds and prints the largest and smallest elements.

Sort Array in Ascending Order

Sorts a 1D array in ascending order and prints the result.

Insert Element in Array

Inserts a new element at a specified position in an array.

Circular Data Logger

Implements a fixed-size circular buffer.

Inserts new sensor values and overwrites oldest when full.

Prints stored values in chronological order.

2D Array Traversal

Creates and initializes a 2D array (6x4).

Traverses and prints each element with its row and column indices.
